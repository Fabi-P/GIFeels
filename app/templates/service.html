<h3>Privacy Policy for GIFeels</h3>
<br>
<h4>Effective Date: 19/01/2025</h4>
<br>
<p>[GIFeels] ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your personal information when you use our web application ("the App").</p>
<p><strong>1. Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>a. Account Information: When you sign up for an account, we collect your email address and any other information you provide during registration.</p>
<p>b. When you log in using an OAuth provider (e.g., Google), we receive certain information from that provider, such as your name, email address, and profile picture (if applicable). The exact data shared depends on the provider and your privacy settings with them. The data received via OAuth is used solely for authentication, account creation, and providing access to your account.</p>
<p>We do not access or store any sensitive information beyond what is necessary to operate the App.</p>
<p>c. Saved Entries: We store entries you save in the App.</p>
<p>d. Automatically Collected Information: We may collect technical data such as your IP address, browser type, and device information to ensure the App operates securely and efficiently.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>2. How We Use Your Information</strong></p>
<p>We use your information to:</p>
<p>- Provide, maintain, and improve the App.</p>
<p>- Allow you to log in and manage your saved entries.</p>
<p>- Respond to account deletion requests.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>3. How You Can Manage Your Information:</strong></p>
<p>a. Deleting Entries: You can delete individual entries directly within the App.</p>
<p>b. Deleting Your Account: If you wish to delete your account, please email us at thompson.rachel1993@gmail.com. We will delete your account and all associated data within 30 days of receiving your request.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>4. Data Sharing:</strong></p>
<p>- We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties except when required by law or for necessary technical purposes (e.g., hosting services).</p>
<p>- We use third-party OAuth providers for authentication purposes. These providers operate under their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review those policies to understand how your data is handled.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>5. Data Security:</strong></p>
<p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>6. Data Retention:</strong></p>
<p>We retain your data as long as your account is active. If you delete an entry or your account, the corresponding data will be permanently removed from our systems.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>7. Your Rights:</strong></p>
<p>Under UK data protection laws, you have the right to:</p>
<p>- Access, correct, or delete your personal information.</p>
<p>- Restrict or object to processing.</p>
<p>- Lodge a complaint with the Information Commissionerâ€™s Office (ICO).</p>
<p>- To exercise your rights, please contact us at thompson.rachel1993@gmail.com.</p>
<p>- You can manage your OAuth settings directly through the third-party provider's platform. For example, you can revoke access to the App from your Google or Facebook account settings.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy:</strong></p>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
